        - title: How does nikgapps config work if I am sideloading gapps or my device storage is encrypted?
          content:
            - ans: If internal storage of your device is not encrypted, the recovery can read the files from your storage and thus, nikgapps.config will be read by default from /sdcard/NikGapps folder
            - ans: If internal storage of your device is encrypted, the recovery cannot read the files from your storage and thus, you need to place nikgapps.config in the same folder as the gapps zip file and the recovery will read it from there
            - ans: If you are sideloading gapps, you can place the nikgapps.config in /tmp folder and the recovery will read it from there
            - ans: Alternatively, you can also edit the nikgapps.config file in the gapps zip file and then flash it only this time, you need to set use_zip_config=1 in nikgapps.config file to instruct the installer to use the config file placed in the gapps zip you are flashing
