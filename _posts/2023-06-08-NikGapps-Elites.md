## How to Join NikGapps Elites:

- **Step 1**: Join the contributors list by making a contribution in one of the following 3 ways
    1. [Become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/nikgapps) or Make a donation of any amount to NikGapps via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/inikhilmenghani) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/nikgapps).
    2. Recommend NikGapps to your ROM.
    3. Contribute code to NikGapps or help address a critical issue.
- **Step 2**: Create an issue [here](https://github.com/nikgapps/config/issues/new), add the details of your contribution in the issue description for nikgapps team to review and add the folder name you need access to in the issue title.
- **Step 3**: Once your contribution is verified, your github account will be added to the NikGapps Elites list and you will then be able to configure your elite build (check below on how).

## NikGapps Elites: Configuration and Working:

- Similar to [creating user builds](https://github.com/nikgapps/config), you can now create an elite build by submitting a pull request to the elite folder.
- Create a (pre-approved) folder and config file at `elite/<android_version>/<folder_name>/<elite>.config`.
- The `android_version` signifies the Android version of your elite build, while `folder_name` indicates the name of your dedicated folder on SourceForge where your elite build will be hosted.
- You can have multiple folders under your name for different purposes, such as personal builds and supporting device builds.
- Each new stable release automatically generates an elite build that is made available in your dedicated SourceForge folder.

## FAQs:

**Q: What is the difference between a user build and an elite build?**
- User builds are manually requested and tailored for individual needs, available in a shared SourceForge folder, unsigned, unvalidated, and less compressed. Elite builds, on the other hand, are automatically created with each release, designed for broader use, available in a dedicated SourceForge folder, signed, validated, and more compressed for faster downloads and less storage use.


**Q: Is this a paid feature?**
- No, it's not a paid feature, but a way to honor valuable contributions to the NikGapps project. Donations are welcomed as a form of recognition and appreciation for the NikGapps team's work.

**Q: Why aren't all exclusives available to everyone?**
- We would love to bring all these exclusives to everyone but at the same time we want to reward and honor the invaluable contributions made to the NikGapps project. A lot of people have made monetary contribution/donation and never came forward. We believe that this is the best way to do it.

**Q: What if I don't want to be an elite?**
- You can still create user builds and receive NikGapps updates and bug fixes. However, elite exclusives will not be available.

**Q: What if I no longer wish to be an elite?**
- After you have been added to the NikGapps Elites list, you can request to be removed from the list by creating an issue [here](https://github.com/nikgapps/config/issues/new). 

**Q: What if I want to add another folder or change my folder name?**
- You can request folder modifications [here](https://github.com/nikgapps/config/issues/new), subject to NikGapps team's approval for genuineness.

**Q: Will there be more elite exclusives in the future?**
- Yes, more exclusives will be added for NikGapps Elites.

**Q: What if there is a bug in the elite build?**
- Report any bugs in the elite build [here](https://github.com/nikgapps/config/issues/new) for the NikGapps team to address.


Thank you for your support, and a warm welcome to NikGapps Elites!
