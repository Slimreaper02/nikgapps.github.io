                        Follow the Note: section of the changelog to find the recommendations on clean/dirty flash
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you don't see any instructions on Note: section, follow below guidelines
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dirty flashing gapps aren't really necessary! If your current setup is in working state, you have no reason to dirty flash. The apps will automatically update from Playstore.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can choose to flash a newer update when you are clean flashing your Rom
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you are facing some issues with your current setup and you find a fix to the issue in the changelog of the gapps update, clean flash! This ensures that any residue factor is not impacting the actual fix
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you can risk your system get into unstable state (with the flexibility of clean flashing at will) then dirty flash!

                        As with other kind of software releases, basically canary is technically a test, alpha, beta, whatever you call it. 
                        Has some improvements with quick fixes for previous issues. 
                        Main releases are more stable though it would be releases at a later date than canary. 
                        If you want to have a more stable update go for release, if you want bleeding edge, bugs be damned, go canary

                    <li><b>How to take logcat if you face bootloop?</b><br>
                        If something is wrong with your device not booting up, try booting it without gapps to ensure
                        the bootloop is sure to gapps<br>
                        If you narrow the root cause down to gapps, try to get a logcat during bootloop<br>
                        Steps to get a logcat during bootloop<br>
                        - boot into the system while flashing only ROM<br>
                        - enable debugging in Developer settings<br>
                        - run adb shell and enable connection on the phone<br>
                        - reboot to recovery<br>
                        - dirty flash gapps<br>
                        - boot and try logcat again<br>

                    Yes, now you can flash NikGapps addons independent of NikGapps. However, the recommendation is to flash on top of NikGapps to avoid any conflicts.
